    <h1>Code Quality Report</h1>

    <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> This report provides a detailed analysis of the code, focusing on identifying quality issues, correctness, security vulnerabilities, and suggestions for improvements.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Documentation:</strong> The code is intended to load CSV data into an SQLite database, execute queries, and manage database tables. It is tailored for quick data analysis and extraction using temporary in-memory databases.</p>

    <div class="section-header">Issues Found:</div>
    <div class="issue-list">
        <div class="issue">
            <span class="severity high">High Severity</span>
            <p class="recommendation">Recommendation 1:</p>
            <p class="description">The code is susceptible to SQL injection attacks due to untreated string concatenation in SQL queries.</p>
            <div class="suggestion">
                <strong>Suggested Improvement:</strong> Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injections, such as using placeholders with cursor's `execute` method.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="issue">
            <span class="severity high">High Severity</span>
            <p class="recommendation">Recommendation 2:</p>
            <p class="description">The database connection should be closed properly even when an exception occurs to ensure resources are released.</p>
            <div class="suggestion">
                <strong>Suggested Improvement:</strong> Use a `with` statement for database connections, which ensures that connections are closed automatically.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="issue">
            <span class="severity medium">Medium Severity</span>
            <p class="recommendation">Recommendation 3:</p>
            <p class="description">Error messages are printed directly, which can expose sensitive information.</p>
            <div class="suggestion">
                <strong>Suggested Improvement:</strong> Log error messages using a logging framework rather than printing them, allowing better control over log levels and destinations.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="issue">
            <span class="severity medium">Medium Severity</span>
            <p class="recommendation">Recommendation 4:</p>
            <p class="description">Inefficient handling of file paths and potential errors due to reliance on `__file__` for determining relative data paths.</p>
            <div class="suggestion">
                <strong>Suggested Improvement:</strong> Consider using environment variables or configuration files for specifying data directories, increasing flexibility and robustness.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="issue">
            <span class="severity low">Low Severity</span>
            <p class="recommendation">Recommendation 5:</p>
            <p class="description">Lack of modularity in functions such as `format_sql_result`, as it contains multiple responsibilities.</p>
            <div class="suggestion">
                <strong>Suggested Improvement:</strong> Refactor functions to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle, separating formatting from querying logic.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="issue">
            <span class="severity low">Low Severity</span>
            <p class="recommendation">Recommendation 6:</p>
            <p class="description">Implicit assumptions in code logic, such as splitting SQL queries to determine table names, can lead to incorrect behavior with complex queries.</p>
            <div class="suggestion">
                <strong>Suggested Improvement:</strong> Use regex or a SQL parsing library to more reliably extract table names and components from SQL queries.
